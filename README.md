# **KursLab**

## Introduction
Welcome to the **EducationAPI** project! This project serves as an interactive educational platform where users can enroll in courses, watch educational content, rate courses, comment on lessons, and like comments. Additionally, users can become instructors, upload their own courses, and manage their content.

## Project Overview
EducationAPI is a **RESTful API** developed using **.NET 8**, designed to support a scalable and secure education platform. It allows users to:
- Register and log in to access educational content.
- Watch and interact with courses by rating, commenting, and liking comments.
- Become instructors and upload their own educational content.
- Manage their courses through an instructor panel, where they can edit, delete, and view statistics on their courses.
- Administrators can manage users, comments, ratings, and oversee all courses and statistics through an admin panel.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages modern technologies for performance, security, and maintainability:

- **.NET 8** - Latest version of the .NET framework for high-performance APIs.
- **Layered Architecture** - Separation of concerns for scalability and maintainability.
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for database interactions.
- **Identity Framework** - User authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Secure user authentication.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for storing content and user data.
- **AutoMapper** - Simplifies object-to-object mapping.
- **Swagger** - API documentation and testing.

## Project Architecture
The **EducationAPI** project follows a **layered architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability:
